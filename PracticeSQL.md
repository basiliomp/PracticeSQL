## First tasks to solve using SQL:

Query example for consulting names in the table people for those entries with a value in age larger than 20 and gender equal to 'F' (i.e. female):
```sql
SELECT name FROM people WHERE age > 20 AND gender = 'F'
```
```sql
ALTER TABLE people ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR (10);
```
Difference between ``DROP`` and ``DELETE``? ``DELETE`` changes the data, while ``DROP`` modifies the data and the data structure (with ``DROP table;`` the table no longer exists).
Difference between ``EDIT`` and ``ALTER``? Similar
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
SELECT age FROM people ORDER BY variable ASC; (for ascending sorting)
```
The two following queries are equivalent! (``BETWEEN`` takes inclusive values at the limits)
```sql
SELECT name FROM people WHERE age >= 20 OR age <= 30;
SELECT name FROM people WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
```
Some basic statistics calculations (average, count, standard deviation, maximun and minimum in this example):
```sql
SELECT AVG(age), COUNT(age), STD(age), MAX(age), MIN(age) FROM people;
```
Grouping and group by calculations
```sql
SELECT nationality, AVG(age) FROM people GROUP BY nationality;
```
Filters over groups (not files!) need the operator HAVING:
```sql
SELECT nationality, AVG(age) FROM people GROUP BY nationality HAVING AVG(age) > 30;
```
**Join and alias**
The letter after the name of the table creates an alias for that table that we can later call, and specify variables in that table with a dot (p.id).
This is the first query presented in more than one line because of its complexity.
```sql
SELECT * FROM people p
	JOIN studies s ON p.id = s.student_id 
	JOIN subjects sb ON s.subject_id = sb.id;
```
If nothing is specified about the JOIN, it will be executed as an inner join (that is the case above).

## Questions to solve using SQL:

1. What are the primary keys of each table?
We can check it at the user interface (UI) because the table shows a yellow key along the name of that variable that is the primary key.
Another way to do that is using the following command with each table:
```DESCRIBE table;```

2. What are the subjects registered?
```SELECT DISTINCT (name) FROM subjects;```

3. Which fields are taught?
```SELECT DISTINCT field FROM subjects;```

4. Which subject is taught by Grace Hopper?
```sql
SELECT p.name, s.name
    FROM people as p
    JOIN teaches as t ON p.id = t.teacher_id 
    JOIN subjects as s ON t.subject_id = s.id
    WHERE p.name = 'Grace Hopper';
```
5. Who are the teacher for the subject 'Compilers'?
```sql
SELECT y.year, p.name
	FROM people as p
    LEFT JOIN teaches as t ON p.id = t.teacher_id
    LEFT JOIN subjects as s ON t.subject_id = s.id
    WHERE s.name = 'Compilers';
```
There were Grace Hooper in 2016 and Dennis Richtie in 2017.

6. Who are the teachers at this centre? (Answer for last year in database).
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT t.year, p.name
    FROM people as p
    LEFT JOIN teaches as t ON p.id = t.teacher_id
    WHERE t.year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM teaches);
```

7. How many teachers work at this centre? (Answer for last year in database)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.name)
    FROM people as p
    LEFT JOIN teaches as t ON p.id = t.teacher_id
    WHERE t.year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM teaches);
```
10 in 2017.

8. How many subjects are related to each teacher? 
```sql
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(subject_id) AS n_subjects
	FROM teaches
    WHERE year = 2017
    GROUP BY(teacher_id)
    ORDER BY n_subjects DESC;
```
9. What is the subject with more students registered?
```sql
SELECT s1.name, COUNT(DISTINCT s2.student_id) AS n_students
	FROM subjects AS s1
    LEFT JOIN studies AS s2
    ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    GROUP BY s1.name
    ORDER BY n_students DESC
    LIMIT 3;

Advanced programming with 20 students in 2017.

--SELECT ss.subject_id, s.name, COUNT (*) AS n_students
--	FROM studies ss
--	JOIN subject s ON s.id = ss.subject_id
--	GROUP BY ss.subject_id
--	ORDER BY n_students DESC;
```
10. Who is the student signed up for more subjects?
```sql
-- Good solution
SELECT p.name, COUNT(DISTINCT s.subject_id) AS n_subjects
	FROM people AS p
    LEFT JOIN studies AS s
    ON p.id = s.student_id
    GROUP BY p.name
    ORDER BY n_subjects DESC
    LIMIT 3;
```
Pierre-Simon Laplace and Christiaan Huygens, both with 9 subjects.

```sql
-- Subquery method
SELECT new_studies.student_id COUNT (*) AS n_subjects
	FROM (SELECT DISTINCT ss.student_id, ss.subject_id FROM Studies ss) AS new_studies
	JOIN people p ON p.id = new_studies.student_id
	GROUP BY new_studies.student_id
	ORDER BY n_subjects DESC

SELECT ss.student_id, COUNT(*) AS n_registers
	FROM Studies ss
	JOIN people p ON p.id = ss.student_id
	GROUP BY ss.student_id
	ORDER BY n_registers DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Proposed solution:
SELECT ss.student_id, COUNT(*) AS n_registers
	FROM Studies ss
	JOIN people p ON p.id = ss.student_id
	GROUP BY ss.student_id
	ORDER BY n_registers DESC LIMIT 1;
```
11. Who is the student registered with more credit hours?
```sql
SELECT p.name, SUM(s2.credits) AS n_credits
	FROM people AS p
    LEFT JOIN studies AS s
    ON p.id = s.student_id
    LEFT JOIN subjects AS s2
    ON s.subject_id = s2.id
    GROUP BY p.name
    ORDER BY n_credits DESC
    LIMIT 1;
```
Christiaan Huygens with 135 credits.

12. What is the most frequent nationality among teachers?
```sql
SELECT p.nationality, COUNT(DISTINCT t.teacher_id) AS n
	FROM people AS p
    INNER JOIN teaches AS t
    ON p.id = t.teacher_id
    GROUP BY p.nationality
    ORDER BY n DESC;
``` 
American, with 5 registers.

Here may be interesting checking the list of ``teacher_id`` included ineach group. For that we can use the command at the start of the query:
```sql
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT t.teacher_id), p.nationality, COUNT(DISTINCT t.teacher_id) AS n
	FROM people AS p
    INNER JOIN teaches AS t
    ON p.id = t.teacher_id
    GROUP BY p.nationality
    ORDER BY n DESC;
```

13. What is the average age of people studying "Data mining"?
```sql
SELECT AVG(p.age) AS avg_age
	FROM people AS p
    INNER JOIN studies AS s1
    ON p.id = s1.student_id
    INNER JOIN subjects AS s2
    ON s1.subject_id = s2.id
    WHERE s2.name = 'Data mining';
```
25.9 years.

14. What is the average grade in "Algebra"?
```sql
SELECT AVG(s2.mark)
	FROM subjects AS s1
    JOIN studies AS s2
    ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    WHERE s1.name = "Algebra";
```
5.8

15. What is the average grade for Computer science subjects ('cs')?
```sql
SELECT AVG(s2.mark) AS average_grade
	FROM subjects AS s1
    JOIN studies AS s2
    ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    WHERE s1.field = "cs";
```
For the total of subjects in that field, the average grade is 6.5.

If we want to know the average grade for *each* subject in the Computer Sciences field, the adecuate query would be:
```sql
SELECT s1.name, AVG(s2.mark) AS average_grade
	FROM subjects AS s1
    JOIN studies AS s2
    ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    WHERE s1.field = "cs"
    GROUP BY s1.name;
```
With the following result:

| name | average_grade |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Intro to programming | 5.3889 |
| Compilers | 6.2000 |
| Algorithms | 6.6429 |
| Hardware | 6.4667 |
| Computer science | 7.4444 | 
| Computer networks | 7.3846 |
| Artificial Intelligence |	6. 4444 |
| Advanced programming | 6.8000 |

16. What is the average grade for "mat" (Mathematics) among those that passed?
```sql
SELECT AVG(s2.mark) AS average_grade
	FROM subjects AS s1
    JOIN studies AS s2
    	ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    WHERE s1.field LIKE '%mat%'
    	AND s2.mark >= 5;
```
For all the students and all subjects, the average grade in matemathics subjects is 7.2.

17. Who is the student with the best average grade?
```sql
SELECT p.name, AVG(s.mark) AS avg_grade
	FROM people AS p
    LEFT JOIN studies as s
    ON p.id = s.student_id
    GROUP BY p.id
    ORDER BY avg_grade DESC
    LIMIT 3;
```
Nicolaus Copernicus and Richard Stallman both with 8.5.

18. Each credit-hour costs â‚¬30 on application, so how much money earned the learning centre each year?
```sql
SELECT s2.year, SUM(s1.credits) * 30 AS income
	FROM subjects AS s1
    JOIN studies AS s2
    ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    GROUP BY s2.year;
```

19. Which subjects are taught by one teacher only?
```sql
SELECT s1.name, COUNT( DISTINCT t.teacher_id) AS n_teachers
	FROM subjects AS s1
    JOIN teaches AS t
    ON s1.id = t.subject_id
    JOIN studies AS s2
    ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    GROUP BY s1.name
    HAVING n_teachers < 2;

-- Another take on the problem, considering subjects over different years:
SELECT s1.name, s2.year, COUNT( DISTINCT t.teacher_id) AS n_teachers
	FROM subjects AS s1
    LEFT JOIN teaches AS t
     ON s1.id = t.subject_id
    LEFT JOIN studies AS s2
     ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    GROUP BY s2.year, s1.name
    HAVING n_teachers < 2;
-- The solution is still the same.
```
Artificial intelligence and Gaulois theory. 

20. If teachers were to earn a 30% of the cost of their subjects, how much should each of them be paid?
```sql
SELECT t.teacher_id, s2.year, SUM(s1.credits) * 30 AS annual_salary
	FROM subjects AS s1
    JOIN studies AS s2
    ON s1.id = s2.subject_id
    JOIN teaches AS t
    ON s1.id = t.subject_id
    GROUP BY s2.year, t.teacher_id
    ORDER BY annual_salary DESC;
```
